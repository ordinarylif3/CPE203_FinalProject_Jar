Final Project: "A Very Merry Bloody Christmas" 

Lore:
As Christmas approaches, you grew more tired of the working conditions and the pay (or the lack thereof). 
You decided it is finally time to escape from Santa’s evil grasp, 
in order to do so you must first find the portal and harness enough magical energy to power it up. 
What better way to get magical power than from the magical beast that flies Santa’s sleigh? 
Once you have killed…errr I mean gather the energy from 3 or more Reindeers you are good to go. 
However, beware of Santa’s wrath. As you eliminate more Reindeers he becomes faster and more powerful. 
Good luck and may the odds be in your favor.

Instructions:
Use arrow Keys to move. Once you kill 3 or more reindeers (Using Shift), head to the exit and interact (Shift) with it to win!

Each time you start the game, the "Exit" will spawn at a different place.
As you eliminate more reindeers Santa's pathing will change from a simple singlestep moving diagonally to the fastest once you 
eliminate 3 or more, which is the AStar pathing with diagonal neighbors. 

1. To trigger event pressed either left mouse click anywhere of the map or "shift" when next to reindeer
2. If mouse clicked and new santa will spawn and an obstacle will also be placed. 
   If "shift' next to reindeer the elf will eliminate the reindeer adding to the resourceCount and 
   blood splatter will appear.
3. The obstacle will block your path and the santa's path to catch you but will also spawn an
   extra santa to catch you.
4. The reindeer now dead will also be an obstacle that you can no longer go through.
